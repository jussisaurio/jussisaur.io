# About me

I am a 31-year-old web developer from Tampere, Finland.

I first touched code at around 11 years old, making rudimentary (complex at the time!) games with QuickBasic and a few very very simple websites.

Then, for some reason (neither I or my parents remember) I stopped altogether for over 15 years. Then in October 2016 I quit my telemarketing job
and decided it was time to start coding again. A few months submerged in Tutorial Land passed, and I managed to land my first job.

Currently I work at [Intopalo Digital](https://www.intopalodigital.com) in an industrial automation project. Most of my work involves JavaScript,
so I wanted to make this website completely JS-free to make the web a better, lighter place to navigate. :)
